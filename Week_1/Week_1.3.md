What is the difference between an incident and a breach? 

        An incident is a security event that compromises the integrity, confidentiality or availability of an information asset. A breach is an incident that results in the confirmed disclosure—not just potential exposure—of data to an unauthorized party.

What percentage of breaches were perpetrated by outside actors? What percentage were perpetrated by internal actors? 

        69% were perpetrated by outside actors. 34% were perpetrated by internal actors.


What percentage of breaches were perpetrated by organized criminal groups? 

        39% were perpetrated by organized criminal groups. 

What percentage of breaches were financially motivated? 

        71% of breaches were financially motivated. It is still the most common motivation behind data breaches. 

Define the following: 

Denial of Service:
 
        A Denial of Service attack aims to make a machine or network completely inaccessible by flooding it with traffic or via other mechanisms that will cause a crash.


Command and Control: 

        A command and control server is a computer controlled by a hacker, used to send commands to other systems that they have already compromised. The attacker begins by hacking a computer, and once that machine has been compromised, it will establish communication with the Command and Control server, and will wait on instructions from C2 server for what to do next. 

Backdoor:

        A backdoor is a hidden entrance to a computer system that a hacker can use to gain access to the system. It is essentially a security vulnerability that a hacker can exploit by installing malware at these points of entry.

Keylogger: 

        A keylogger is a type of malware that will record every stroke a person makes on their computer. A hacker can use this to obtain information such as usernames and passwords. 


The time from an attacker’s first action to the initial compromise of an asset is typically measured in which one? Seconds, minutes, hours, days? 

        Minutes


When it comes to phishing, which industry has the highest click rates?

        Education
