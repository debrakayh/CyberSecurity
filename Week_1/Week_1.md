Security 101 Homework: Security Reporting
Part I: Symantec
For Part 1 of your homework assignment, you should primarily use the Symantec Internet Security Threat Report along with independent research to answer the following questions.
________________________________________
1.	What is formjacking?

        Malicious Javascript code is injected into a website, allowing hackers to take control over the site’s form page in order to collect sensitive user information. This can be used to steal credit card details and other information from payment forms. 

2.	How many websites are compromised each month with formjacking code? 

        4800

3.	What is Powershell?

        Powershell is a command line scripting language on Windows operating systems, designed specifically for systems administration. It helps IT and security professionals control and automate many tasks.

4.	What was the annual percentage increase in malicious Powershell scripts?

        1000%

5.	What is a coinminer?

        Coinminer is software and malware that can take over a computer’s resources and use them for cryptocurrency. 

6.	How much can data from a single credit card can be sold for? 

        $45

7.	How did Magecart successfully attack Ticketmaster? 

        Magecart loaded malicious code into the web browsers of Ticketmaster’s customers, with the aim of harvesting payment data. 

8.	What is one reason why there has been a growth of formjacking? 

        Because of the drop in cryptocurrencies, hackers who originally used website for cryptojacking are now opting for form jacking, since the value of a stolen credit card information is currently assumed more valuable that cryptocurrencies.

9.	Cryptojacking dropped by what percentage between January and December 2018?

        Down by 52%. 

10.	If a web page contains a coinmining script, what happens?

         The web page visitors’ computing power will be used to mine for cryptocurrency for as long as the web page is open.

11.	How does an exploit kit work? 

        Exploit kits can exploit security holes found in software application. If the exploit succeeds on a victim’s computer, a malicious payload is downloaded and executed.

12.	What does the criminal group SamSam specialize in? 

        They specialize in targeted ransomware attacks. They break into networks and can encrypt multiple computers and ask for a large ransom demand.

13.	How many SamSam attacks did Symantec find evidence of in 2018? 

        67

14.	Even though ransomware attacks declined in 2017-2018, what was one dramatic change that occurred?

        Up until 2017, consumers were the hardest hit by ransomware, accounting for the majority of infections. 
        
        In 2017, the balance tipped towards enterprises, with the majority of infections occurring in businesses. 

        In 2018, that shift accelerated and enterprises accounted for 81 percent of all ransomware infections. While overall ransomware infections were down, enterprise infections were up by 12 percent in 2018.
         
15.	In 2018, what was the primary ransomware distribution method?

        Email Campaigns       

16.	What operating systems do most types of ransomware attacks still target?

        Windows-based OS

17.	What are “living off the land” attacks? What is the advantage to hackers? 

        These are attacks in which hackers use tools that are already installed on the victim’s computers, instead of using other outside tools.

        By using these native tools, hackers can more easily hide their activity amidst the legitimate processes occurring on a victim’s computer. And even if the malicious activity is identified, it is harder to attribute and identify the specific attacks and attackers.

18.	What is an example of a tool that’s used in “living off the land” attacks?

        Powershell Scripts

19.	What are zero-day exploits?

        These are attacks that occur on the same day that a vulnerability is found i software. The vulnerability can therefore be exploited before a patch has been developed to fix it.

20.	By what percentage did zero-day exploits decline 2018?

        Only 23 percent of attack groups were known to use zero days, down from 27 percent in 2017.

21.	What are two techniques that worms such as Emotet and Qakbot use?

        Dumping passwords from memory and brute-forcing access to network shares laterally move across a network. 

22.	What are supply chain attacks? By how much did they increase in 2018?

        Supply chain attacks, which exploit third-party services and software to compromise a final target, take many forms, including hijacking software updates and injecting malicious code into legitimate software. They increased by 78% in 2018.

23.	What challenge do supply chain attacks and living off the land attacks highlight for organizations? 

        Attacks are increasingly arriving through trusted channels, using fileless attack methods or legitimate tools for malicious purposes. 

24.	The 20 most active groups tracked by Symantec targeted an average of how many organizations between 2016 and 2018? 

        55

25.	How many individuals or organizations were indicted for cyber criminal activities in 2018? What are some of the countries that these entities were from?

         49 individuals or organizations were indicted. They came from nationals and individuals from Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. 

26.	When it comes to the increased number of cloud cybersecurity attacks, what is the common theme? 

        Poor or misconfigured cloud resources on the internet. 

27.	What is the implication for successful cloud exploitation that provides access to memory locations that are normally forbidden? 

        This is particularly problematic for cloud services because, while cloud instances have their own virtual processors, they share pools of memory. Therefore, a successful attack on a single physical system could result in data being leaked from several cloud instances.

28.	What are two examples of the above cloud attack? 

        Meltdown and Spectre

29.	Regarding Internet of Things (IoT) attacks, what were the two most common infected devices and what percentage of IoT attacks were attributed to them? 

        Routers and connected cameras were the most infected devices and accounted for 75 and 15 percent of the attacks respectively. It’s unsurprising that routers were the most targeted devices given their accessibility from the internet. They’re also attractive as they provide an effective jumping-off point for attackers.

30.	What is the Mirai worm and what does it do? 

        This self-propagating worm exploits weak security on many IoT devices. It infects devices with malware that forces them to report to a central control server, turning them into a bot that can be used in DDoS attacks

31.	Why was Mirai the third most common IoT threat in 2018?

        Mirai is constantly evolving and variants use up to 16 different exploits, persistently adding new exploits to increase the success rate for infection, as devices often remain unpatched. The worm also expanded its target scope by going after unpatched Linux servers.

32.	What was unique about VPNFilter with regards to IoT threats?

        VPNFilter was the first widespread persistent IoT threat, with its ability to survive a reboot making it very difficult to remove. With an array of potent payloads at its disposal, such as man in the middle (MitM) attacks, data exfiltration, credential theft, and interception of SCADA communications, VPNFilter was a departure from traditional IoT threat activity such as DDoS and coin mining. It also includes a destructive capability which can “brick,” or wipe a device at the attackers’ command, should they wish to destroy evidence.

33.	What type of attack targeted the Democratic National Committee in 2019?

        Spear-fishing attack

34.	What were 48% of  malicious email attachments in 2018? 

        Office files

35.	What were the top two malicious email themes in 2018? 

        Bill and email delivery failures

36.	What was the top malicious email attachment type in 2018?

         37% of all attachments were either .doc or .dot files.

37.	Which country had the highest email phishing rate? Which country had the lowest email phishing rate?

        Saudi Arabia had the highest phishing rate and Poland had the lowest.

38.	What is Emotet and how much did it jump in 2018? 

        Emotete is a type of banking Trojan which gains access to financial information by injecting computer code into the networking stack of an infected Microsoft Windows computer, allowing sensitive data to be stolen via transmission. It accounted for 16% of financial Trojans, up from 4% in 2017. 

39.	What was the top malware threat of the year? How many of those attacks were blocked?

        Heur.AdvML.C with 43,999,373 blocked attacks.

40.	Malware primarily attacks which type of operating system? 

        Windows

41.	What was the top coinminer of 2018 and how many of those attacks were blocked? 

        JS.Webcoinminer with  2,768,721 blocked attacks

42.	What were the top three financial Trojans of 2018? 

        Ramnit, Zbot, and Emotet

43.	What was the most common avenue of attack in 2018? 

        Spear-phishing email attacks
    
44.	What is destructive malware? By what percent did these attacks increase in 2018?

         Destructive malware has the ability to make infected systems inoperable, thereby making recovery and reconstitution more difficult. They typically incorporate a disk wiper component which allows them to destroy data and programs on systems. 

        Eight percent of groups were known to use destructive tools, up from 6 percent at the end of 2017.

45.	What was the top user name used in IoT attacks? 

        Root

46.	What was the top password used in IoT attacks? 

        123456

47.	What were the top three protocols used in IoT attacks? What were the top two ports used in IoT attacks? 

        Telnet, http, and https were the top three protocols. Port 23 (for Telnet) and port 80 (for http) were used. 

48.	In the underground economy, how much can someone get for the following? 

a.	Stolen or fake identity:

        $.10-1.50
b.	Stolen medical records:

        $.10-.35

c.	Hacker for hire:

        $100+

d.	Single credit card with full details:
