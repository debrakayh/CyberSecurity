Step 1: Measure and Set Goals
Answer the following questions:
1. Using outside research, indicate the potential security risks of allowing employees to access work information on their personal devices. Identify at least three potential attacks that can be carried out.

        Tailgating
        Physical access to network (Lost, ‘borrowed’ or stolen devices) 
        Malicious Code (Phishing/Malware)

2. Based on the above scenario, what is the preferred employee behavior?

        Swipe badge to enter building and sensitive rooms (one swipe, one body)
        Keep device(s) on your person or in a safe location at all times,
        Protect with a strong password/always lock when not in possession.
        Never click on unknown links/install proper security software

3. What methods would you use to measure how often employees are currently not behaving according to the preferred behavior?

        Do a physical scan of the workplace to see if there are any unknown people there (have other employees report). 
        Keep a log of how many times a person has reported a lost or stolen device or you can tell by how many times they need to (re)download company software.
        Do a survey to see how many employees open suspicious emails and/or check the help desk calls for individuals needing help removing malware.

4. What is the goal that you would like the organization to reach regarding this behavior?

        5%
        10%
        5%

Step 2: Involve the Right People
Now that you have a goal in mind, who needs to be involved?
Indicate at least five employees or departments that need to be involved. For each person or department, indicate in 2-3 sentences what their role and responsibilities will be.

        Employee
        Employee’s direct manage
        CIO
        HR
        Security team

Step 3: Training Plan
Training is part of any security culture framework plan. How will you train your employees on this security concern? In one page, indicate the following:
How frequently will you run training? What format will it take? (i.e. in-person, online, a combination of both)

        Company Newsletter
        I would have a FAQ section in the company newsletter specifically regarding security.
        There would also be a tip in each episode of the newsletter
        There will be mention of the importance of security at each ‘All Hands On’ meeting whether this be monthly or quarterly will be up to management with at least 20 minutes dedicated to specifics (stats, tips, company policy and consequences).
        There will be an online training course that must be passed yearly.  Results will be submitted to HR.


What topics will you cover in your training and why? (This should be the bulk of the deliverable.)

        List out the dangers of each subject
        Tailgating - physical harm (active shooter), theft of physical devices, theft of software or data, implanting malware on unmanned workstations, etc.
        Lost or stolen devices - can be hacked and all employee info as well as client data can be stolen. This will surely result in lawsuits which could bankrupt the company as well as damage the reputation.
        Malicious Code - theft of proprietary software, customer data, financials; can implant ransomware; can install viruses that may delete data or cripple the company.


After you’ve run your training, how will you measure its effectiveness?

        Install cameras to see who is letting unauthorized people in. Plant people to try and influence employees to let them in. 
        Check the logs of how many times a person has reported a lost or stolen device or you can tell by how many times they need to (re)download company software. Require ‘find my phone’ software be installed and turned on.
        Send trick malware to employees so they can practice the proper procedures (DO NOT OPEN and send to security team).  If they open it, send them a reminder about the procedures and test them again. 



Bonus: Other Solutions
Training alone often isn't the entire solution to a security concern.
Indicate at least two other potential solutions. For each one, indicate the following:


What type of control is it? Administrative, technical, or physical?


What goal does this control have? Is it preventive, deterrent, detective, corrective, or compensating?


What is one advantage of each solution?


What is one disadvantage of each solution?
Tailgating:

        Add turnstile
        Physical
        Deterrent
        It is nearly impossible to cheat a turnstile
        This is very costly
        Add a guard
        Physical
        Deterrent
        More accountability
        Also very costly

Physical Access to Networks:

        Add tracking software on all company devices
        Technical
        Detective
        Find the lost device and the criminal who has it
        Employees can easily disable them
        Add encryption to make it harder for criminals to hack in
        Technical
        Preventative
        Can save the company a lot of hassle if things are stolen
        Employees can have a hard time accessing/decrypting work files
Malware/Phishing:

        Revoke all admin rights on work devices
        Technical
        Preventative
        Autorun .exe files cannot run without admin rights
        Some people may need admin rights to do their jobs
        Send trick emails to employees until they are educated and can tell malicious emails from safe ones.
        Administrative
        Detective
        Employees will have plenty of chances to learn without damaging the company
        Some employees may not take it seriously if they think it is just a test.
